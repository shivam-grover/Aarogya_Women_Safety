# Aarogya_Women_Safety

An app for women safety, especially in cabs and pooling in vehicles of other people or public vehicles.

When a woman enters a vehicle(say a cab), our app instantly stores the details of the car and its owner(currently done using a barcode for a proof of concept).
In case of an emergency the woman has to press the power button three times and using geoLocation, the nearest patrolling vehicle/ police station would be located and the live location of the woman will be sent to them using push notifications.

We are planning to include audio transmission as well since it'll make the alert system much more reliable and easier for the police to gather intellince if a constant real time audio feed is being sent to them.
